# QuantumBlog
On 11th April 2018 I presented at the London Quantum Computing Meetup, along with my colleague Anita Ramanan. You can find details of the meetup [here](https://www.meetup.com/London-Quantum-Computing-Meetup/events/248537537/). We looked to answer these questions: 

- What is quantum computing? Why is it important? 
- How do we build a quantum computer?
- What kinds of physical systems are already in development?
- What is Q#/the QDK and why would you use it?
- Can we use Q# to teleport a quantum state?

My part of the talk was based on [my blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/uk_faculty_connection/2018/02/27/quantum-teleportation-in-q/) on quantum teleportation.

## Quantum Teleportation Code
During the talk I did a demo of quantum teleportation in Q#. That is based on the [Microsoft Quantum GitHub repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum/tree/master/Samples/Teleportation). I have also added an additional operation which shows an example of teleporting a more complex quantum state than the classical one we saw in the demo - you can find that code [here](https://github.com/frtibble/QuantumBlog/tree/master/3%20London%20Quantum%20Computing/Quantum%20Teleportation).
